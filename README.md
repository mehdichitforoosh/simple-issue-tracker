## General Info

This project is a simple issue tracker that enables developers to create developers, issues and plan issues based on
estimated point values through a Restful API and a React client UI.

## Architecture

This project uses *Spring Boot* and *Spring Framework* dependency injection (DI) and IoC capabilities to create beans
and inject objects into each other. It also uses *Spring Web MVC* to implement Restful endpoints, *Spring Data Jpa* to
create entities, repositories, *Spring Boot Test, JUnit, and Mockito framework* to run integration and unit tests. It
has a layered architecture with presentation, service, validator and persistence layers.

### Services

The code contains services with using transactions to manage, create, update, delete entities.

You can find services in the `service` sub-package.

### Repositories

The code uses Spring Data Jpa and Hibernate to manage the database and create tables, queries, ...

You can find repositories in the `repository` sub-package.

### Validators

To validate the input data from the client, there is a validator for each entity.

You can find validators in the `validator` sub-package.

### Storage

To store data, there is a default **H2 in-memory data store** to store, access data.

### Domain

This code uses Jpa `@Entity` and `@Table` to create jpa entities.

You can find domains in `domain` sub-package.

### Endpoint (Rest Controller)

To create Rest APIs, there is a rest controller that implements APIs and creates output JSON objects, and processes
input JSON objects.

You can find endpoint implementation in `controller` sub-package.

## Technologies

- Java 11
- Spring Boot 2.6.1
- Maven 3.6.0
- JUnit 5
- Mockito 4
- React.js 17
- Bootstrap 5.0

## Run Test

To run integration and unit tests, you can use:

```
mvn test
```

You can find integration and unit tests in `src/test/java` folder.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Java 11
- Maven 3.6.0
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Running with Docker Compose or Java

To run the application you can either use docker-compose:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You can check the running containers:

```
docker ps
```

or Java:

```
java -jar issue-tracker-1.0.0.jar --server.port=9000
```

### Running with Maven

To run the app you can use the following maven commands:

```
mvn clean test
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once the server is running you can check the results with:

UI:

```
http://localhost:9000/
```

![Planner](https://github.com/mehdichitforoosh/simple-issue-tracker/blob/master/screenshot-2.png?raw=true)

or Rest APIs:

```
POST http://localhost:9000/api/v1/developers
PUT http://localhost:9000/api/v1/developers/{id}
GET http://localhost:9000/api/v1/developers/{id}
GET http://localhost:9000/api/v1/developers?startIndex={start},itemsPerPage={size},name={string}
DELETE http://localhost:9000/api/v1/developers/{id}
```
